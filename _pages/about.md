Hi there! I am a PhD student in Economics at [KU Leuven](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/economics/economics). Prior to this, I completed graduate studies at [Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.gsefm.eu/de/about-us.html), the [University of Bonn](https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/en), and [Paris 1 Sorbonne](https://economie.pantheonsorbonne.fr/). 

My primary research interests lie in Macroeconomics, with particular attention to International Macro and Monetary Economics. I also have an interest in Political Economy.

On this webpage, you can access my CV and research. If you're a student, some links might be useful (or not).
