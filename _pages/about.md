Hi there! I am a PhD student in Economics at [KU Leuven](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/economics/economics).

My primary research interests lie in Macroeconomics, with particular attention to International Macro and Monetary Economics. I also have an interest in Political Economy.

On this webpage, you can access my CV and research.
